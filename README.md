# If-All-the-Animals-Came-Inside
 Capstone Project 2021

If All the Animals Came Inside is an augmented reality story experience based upon the childrenâ€™s book by Eric Pinder. The story follows a young boy as he imagines what would happen if the animals all came inside one day, the preposterousness of it, and the great chaos that would ensue. The If All the Animals Came Inside app is a companion to the story book, and lets children explore the possibilities of wild animals coming inside their own house!
